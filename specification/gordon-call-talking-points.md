# Talking Points — Call with Andy Gordon

### Tuesday, 30 minutes

---

## Opening (5 min)

- Starting point: "Typing a Multi-Language Intermediate Code" (with Don Syme,
  POPL '01) — read it in 2003 and cited it in my own master's thesis on
  JPicolla.
- A formal type-safety spec explicitly tied to the real .NET CIL, not just a
  model of it. LLMbda makes the same move: the interpreter that's proved is the
  interpreter that runs. Worth asking if he sees that as a deliberate
  throughline in how he approaches formal work.

## 1. Competitive/comparative landscape (~4 min)

- The paper directly demonstrates two concrete gaps in **CaMeL**: an
  untaken-branch implicit-flow leak, and an untracked retry-loop bit-leak
  channel. Ask how confident he is those hold up under scrutiny/pushback from
  the **CaMeL** authors.

- FIDES deliberately doesn't track control-flow-carried secrets. Ask if he sees
  that as a reasonable engineering trade-off or a real weakness.

- LBAC/TypeGuard and tacit take a static-typing/capability route instead of
  dynamic IFC. Ask whether he sees these as competitors, or as solving a
  genuinely different problem that could combine with LLMbda later.

## 2. Questions about the calculus (~4 min)

- What if the discrete Untrusted vs Trusted Principal are e.g. likelihoods or
  probabilities rather than booleans? Does the calculus still work, or is that a
  fundamentally different problem?

- In how far is information leakage through termination equivalent to examining
  the current continuation?

## 2. `endorse` misuse (~8 min)

- Insulated TIPNI proves the override stays scoped to one axis — but nothing
  stops an agent plan from calling `endorse` when it shouldn't.

- Both of Randori's successful attacks trace back to this.

- **Ask:** Is there a design pattern (plan-time-only endorsement, harness-level
  restriction) they'd actually recommend, or is this still open?

---

## 3. Where the calculus goes next (~9 min)

- Tool I/O modeling is the paper's own stated gap (NFR-2) — ask what the plan is
  for extending TIPNI's guarantee to real external tools and data sources, not
  just in-program functions.

- Ask how they see LLMbda relating to the static-typing camp (LBAC/ TypeGuard,
  tacit) — genuinely complementary, or is one discipline going to subsume the
  other over time?

- Ask what Randori's error-handling gap (NFR-3) looks like in practice — is that
  a near-term fix or a deeper tension with the IFC design?

---

## Close (2 min)

- Would you kindly provide me access to the LEAN test set. I just finished a PoC
  of a VM in JS/TS that tries to run the LLMBda calculus as specified in the
  paper by Andy Gordon. I now have 100% test coverage, thus the implementation
  in it self is sound. However I do not know whether it implements your test
  set.

- Looking for a mentor and affiliation. Lack of bo
